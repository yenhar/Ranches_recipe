        <h1>Cheese Burger</h1>
        <div>
            <p>A traditional grilled sandwich that consists of ground meat made into a patty, cooked, topped with a slice of cheese, and placed between two halves of a bun to create this favorite international food. Typically made with ground beef, the meat is produced by grinding and blending together various cuts of beef including meat from the shoulder, brisket, and loin. However, the Cheeseburger sandwich can also be made with a variety of ground meats other than beef, such as buffalo, chicken, lamb, pork, and turkey to name a few.

                </ul>
                <ul>

                </ul>
                <ul>

        <h3 >Preparation</h3>
        <div>
            <ol>
                <li>Separate the beef into 4 mounds, or 8 if making double cheeseburgers. Gently roll each mound into a ball (not firmly, we want tender patties not rock hard ones!) then press down into a patty that is slightly wider than the burger bun, to factor in cooking shrinkage.</li>
                <li>hinning the centre of the patty compensates for the tendency of the patty to dome up in the middle as it cooks. It also reduces the overall patty shrinkage during cooking. </li>
                <li>Here’s what it looks like. It doesn’t need to be even or deep, just a slight inwards curve, so the patty is shaped a bit like a red blood cell.</li>
                <li>My second key tip is to only salt the patty just before cooking. If you salt your patty ahead of time and leave it sitting around, the cooked patty ends up much firmer. This is because the salt acts on the meat proteins and changes their chemistry. </li>
