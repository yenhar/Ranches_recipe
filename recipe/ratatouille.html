        <h1>Ratatouille</h1>
        <div>
            <p>Ratatouille is a summer vegetable stew that originated as a French Provencal dish from Nice. Think of the vegetables that grow well in your yard, ready to be picked together in late summer and early fall — that’s ratatouille. It's a stew of zucchini, peppers, tomatoes and eggplant, with herbs and spices and some onions and garlic usually thrown in for good measure. The coast of Provence is on the Mediterranean Sea and has a climate similar to California’s, which means the growing season for the vegetables in ratatouille are available for many months. You wouldn’t have it at dinner for New Year’s Eve, but you might have it in late October through mid-November.</p>

        <h3 >Preparation</h3>
        <div>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven for 375˚F (190˚C).</li>
                <li>Using a sharp knife or a mandoline, slice the eggplant, tomatoes, squash, and zucchini into approximately ¹⁄₁₆-inch (1-mm)-thick rounds, then set aside..</li>
                <li>Make the sauce: Heat the olive oil in a 12-inch (30-cm) oven-safe pan over medium-high heat. Sauté the onion, garlic, and bell peppers until soft, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, then add the crushed tomatoes. Stir until the ingredients are fully incorporated. Remove from heat, then add the basil. Stir once more, then smooth the surface of the sauce with a spatula.</li>
                <li>Arrange the veggies in alternating slices, (for example, eggplant, tomato, squash, zucchini) on top of the sauce, working from the outer edge to the center of the pan. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>Make the herb seasoning: In a small bowl, mix together the basil, garlic, parsley, thyme, salt, pepper, and olive oil. Spoon the herb seasoning over the vegetables.</li>
                <li>Cover the pan with foil and bake for 40 minutes. Uncover, then bake for another 20 minutes, until the vegetables are softened.</li>
                <li>Serve hot as a main dish or side. The ratatouille is also excellent the next day–cover with foil and reheat in a 350˚F (180˚C) oven for 15 minutes, or simply microwave to desired temperature.</li>
                <li>Enjoy!</li>
