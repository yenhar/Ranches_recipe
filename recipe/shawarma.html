        <h1>Beef Shawarma</h1>
        <div>
            <p>Shawarma is a popular Middle Eastern meal that is made from marinated meat, such as lamb, beef, and chicken. It is one of the world’s most popular street foods, especially in Egypt, and is now a staple at most Middle Eastern restaurants. Shawarma is a mouth-watering meal that is sure to please food and meat lovers.
                Shawarma is marinated with various seasonings and spices such as cumin, turmeric, and paprika. It is made by stacking thinly sliced meat, typically lamb, beef, or chicken, on a large rotating skewer or cone. It is also sometimes cooked with extra fat from the meat to give it a juicer taste. The shawarma stack is rotated slowly for hours as it cooks in front of a heat source that continuously roasts the outer layer.
